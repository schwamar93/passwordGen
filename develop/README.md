For this week's assignment I created a random password generator using javascript that would allow the user to choose which variables they would like included into their password.

USER STORY:
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
